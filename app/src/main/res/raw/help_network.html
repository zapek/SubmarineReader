<b>Auto sync</b>
<p>Enables automatic background syncing of articles. The Android framework finds out when it's the best
time to do so depending on network conditions, background data restriction, roaming, battery capacity and if the device is charging. It does it at least once
per day. You can always refresh manually by performing a pull to refresh gesture.</p>
<b>Number of articles to sync</b>
<p>The app will keep this number of recent articles in sync. Keep in mind that only the first sync is significant
as the next ones will only download new articles published after that date. Lower that value if you
have limited bandwidth even for the first sync.</p>
<b>Sync images</b>
<p>Also download the images in the articles when syncing. Turning that off will save quite significant bandwidth
but you won't get images in the articles (unless the next options is turned on).</p>
<b>Direct network access</b>
<p>If enabled, videos and embedded content (eg. twitter posts) will show in articles. Keep in mind that this content
is not fetched during syncing but displayed on demand. If you are mainly interested in text and have limited
bandwidth, turn that off.</p>
